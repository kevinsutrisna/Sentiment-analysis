This project compares the performance of three machine learning algorithms—Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naïve Bayes—on Twitter sentiment analysis. The study classifies sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, using preprocessing techniques on Twitter data and a Kaggle dataset. Key findings reveal that Naïve Bayes is the fastest but least accurate, while SVM achieves the highest accuracy, surpassing Random Forest. Despite their higher computational demands, both SVM and Random Forest show greater resilience to noisy data, making them more reliable than Naïve Bayes in real-world applications.
